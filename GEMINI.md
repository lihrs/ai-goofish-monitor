# Gemini Workspace Configuration

- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- All UI component implementation and documentation should refer to the official shadcn-vue documentation at `https://www.shadcn-vue.com/`.
- All frontend development must strictly adhere to the architecture and specifications defined in the `FRONTEND_REFACTOR_ARCHITECTURE.md` file.
